# Running
You need to provide 3 arguments - starting currency, output currency, and the amount to be converted. With both starting and output currencies being in [ISO format](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes).\
For example, if I wanted to convert 53.43 AUD to GBP, I would type `pyconverter AUD GBP 53.43`
